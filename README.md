## Work Day Scheduler 

This project utilizes jQuery, Bootstrap and Moment.JS.  This daily planner allow a user to keep track pf task throught out the day. Local storage was implemented so that task would persist thru a page refresh or browser closing.

The daily planner uses visual color indicators to show whether a task is in the past, present, or future.
